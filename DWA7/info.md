## DWA7 Changes Made
    
### Changes Made to Implement SOLID Principles in setTheme Function:

1. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP):
   - Simplified setTheme function to only handle determining the current color scheme.
   - Moved the actual theme application logic into separate classes named DarkThemeApplier and LightThemeApplier. Each class now handles applying the theme based on the color scheme.
   - This change ensures that each part of the code has a clear and single responsibility: setTheme figures out the color scheme, while the theme appliers apply the appropriate theme.

2. Open/Closed Principle (OCP):
   - Made setTheme function open for extension but closed for modification.
   - Created a common interface called ThemeApplier for theme appliers and implemented specific theme appliers like DarkThemeApplier and LightThemeApplier that follow this interface.
   - Now, new theme appliers can be added without changing the existing code. This promotes flexibility and makes it easier to maintain and extend the codebase.

3. Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP):
   - Ensured that DarkThemeApplier and LightThemeApplier classes can be substituted for their base class (ThemeApplier) without causing any issues in the program.
  - This ensures that we can easily switch between different theme appliers without worrying about breaking anything. It makes the code more flexible and easier to work with.
